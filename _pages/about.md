I am currently pursuing a PhD at Yonsei University!

:rocket: Research
======
My research primarily focuses on the development of natural language reasoning models and formal language generation.

**:thought_balloon: Reasoning Model**
* Enable the model to learn reasoning using natural language. [TinyThiner](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.309/)
* Enable the model to perform reasoning in latent way. [SpiralThinker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08983)
* Enable the model to update reasoning capability during test-time.

**:pencil2: Formal Language Generation**
* Molecule generation [SELF-EdiT](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-023-04915-8)
* Text2SQL [LitE-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09014)
