* Enable the model to learn reasoning using natural language. [TinyThiner](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.309/)
* Enable the model to perform reasoning in latent way. [To Be Published]
* Enable the model to update reasoning capability during test-time.

**Formal Language Generation**
* Molecule generation [SELF-EdiT](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-023-04915-8)
* Text2SQL [LitE-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09014)
